## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- IPData API
- leaftlet
- React-Leaftlet
- Date-fns
- TailwindCSS
- React
- Vite
- [Ip data](https://ipdata.co/) - IP Geolocation
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS classes
- [React-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React components for Leaflet maps

### What I learned

To use React-Leaflet, a component to create Leaflet maps and use 'fly to' events with a smooth animation.
Also learned to use date-fns to format current time of a timezone given from api.

```formated date
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { formatInTimeZone } from "date-fns-tz";

function FormatDate({ date, timezoneName }) {
  console.log(date, timezoneName);
  const [time, setTime] = useState("");
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    update();
    const newDate = new Date();
    const tempo = formatInTimeZone(
      newDate,
      timezoneName,
      "HH:mm:ss dd-MM-yyyy"
    );
    setTime(tempo);
  }, [seconds]);
  const update = () => setInterval(() => setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1), 1000);

  return <div className="text-lg text-zinc-900 font-bold">{time}</div>;
}
export { FormatDate };
```
